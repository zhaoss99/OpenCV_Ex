1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the order of the pixel structure?
there are three features in cvMat:row,column,type,which could make up a 'matrix'.
so a program could read cvMat object by those features.
as for the order,just like the form Osama showed us:CV <bit depth>(SjUjF) C<number of channels>
first comes with bit depth,then type of values(signed,unsigned,float),last is number of channels.

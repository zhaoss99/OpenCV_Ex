Salt and pepper noise: the value of this noise is not continuous, it has only one extremum value.
so it is obvious to see the clear spots which is brighter in the picture, just feel like crystal salt.


Gauss noise: The Gauss noise is completely determined by the time-varying mean and the two instantaneous covariance function.
If the noise is stationary, then the mean is independent of time. 
The covariance function becomes only the correlation function related to the difference between the two instantaneous reflections,
which is equivalent to the power spectral density in the sense.
